# Enhanced Tally Phase Logic

## Overview

The tally phase has been significantly enhanced beyond simple median calculation to provide robust, intelligent price aggregation with advanced statistical analysis and multiple aggregation methods.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Criteria Outlier Detection

Instead of relying on a single outlier detection method, the enhanced tally phase uses three complementary approaches:

- **IQR (Interquartile Range) Method**: Uses 1.5x IQR rule (or 2.0x for small samples)
- **MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) Method**: More robust against extreme outliers
- **Z-Score Method**: Standard deviation-based outlier detection

The system uses intersection (most conservative) or majority consensus based on data characteristics.

### 2. Multiple Aggregation Methods

The system evaluates multiple aggregation methods and selects the best one based on confidence scores and consensus thresholds:

- **Standard Median**: Robust central tendency measure
- **Trimmed Mean**: Removes 10% from each end before averaging
- **Hodges-Lehmann Estimator**: Median of all pairwise averages (Walsh averages)
- **Weighted Consensus**: Distance-based weighting favoring values near the median

### 3. Advanced Statistical Analysis

Comprehensive statistical metrics are calculated for each price dataset:

- **Basic Statistics**: Min, Max, Mean, Median, Range
- **Variability Measures**: Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation
- **Robust Statistics**: Q1, Q3, IQR, MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)

### 4. Enhanced Price Validation

More sophisticated price validation including:

- **Range Checks**: Reasonable price bounds ($0.000001 to $1M)
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies obviously manipulated values (e.g., all same digits)
- **Uniqueness Validation**: Rejects prices with insufficient digit diversity

### 5. Confidence Scoring System

Each aggregation method receives a confidence score based on:

- **Method Robustness**: Base confidence per method
  - Hodges-Lehmann: 90% (most robust)
  - Median: 85%
  - Trimmed Mean: 80%
  - Weighted Consensus: 75%
- **Sample Size Bonus**: +5 to +15 points based on data availability
- **Consensus Threshold**: Percentage of prices within 5% tolerance

### 6. Consensus Validation

The final result must meet consensus thresholds:

- **Large Datasets** (≥10 points): 70% consensus required
- **Small Datasets** (<10 points): 60% consensus required

### 7. Adaptive Algorithm Selection

The system automatically selects the best aggregation method based on:

- **Data Size**: Different methods for different sample sizes
- **Data Quality**: Weighted combination of confidence (70%) and consensus (30%)
- **Robustness**: Preference for statistically robust methods

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures

```rust
struct AggregationResult {
    price: u128,
    method: AggregationMethod,
    confidence: u8,
    metadata: AggregationMetadata,
}

struct AdvancedStatistics {
    count: usize,
    min: u128,
    max: u128,
    median: u128,
    mean: u128,
    std_dev: u128,
    q1: u128,
    q3: u128,
    iqr: u128,
    mad: u128,
    range: u128,
    coefficient_of_variation: f64,
}
```

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Parse and Validate** price reveals with enhanced validation
2. **Calculate Statistics** comprehensive statistical analysis
3. **Detect Outliers** using multi-criteria approach
4. **Apply Methods** evaluate all applicable aggregation methods
5. **Select Best** choose method with highest combined score
6. **Validate Consensus** ensure sufficient agreement among data points
7. **Report Result** with detailed confidence and metadata
