# üöÄ Ultra-Enhanced Oracle Features

## Overview

The oracle has been transformed into a **military-grade statistical aggregation system** with 8-layer outlier detection, advanced weighted consensus methods, time-weighted averaging, and sophisticated confidence scoring.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Outlier Detection (8 Methods)**

### 1. Enhanced IQR with Adaptive Multipliers
- **Base Method**: Interquartile Range (IQR) with 1.5x multiplier
- **Enhancement**: Adaptive multipliers based on:
  - Sample size (2.5x for small samples, 1.5x for large)
  - Skewness adjustment (up to +0.5 multiplier)
  - Kurtosis adjustment (up to +0.3 multiplier)
- **Advantage**: Automatically adjusts to data distribution characteristics

### 2. Modified Z-Score with Robust Statistics
- **Method**: Uses Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) instead of standard deviation
- **Threshold**: 3.5 (more robust than standard Z-score)
- **Factor**: 1.4826 for normal distribution consistency
- **Advantage**: Immune to outlier contamination in variance calculation

### 3. Grubbs' Test for Extreme Outliers
- **Method**: Statistical test for detecting single outliers
- **Critical Values**: Adaptive based on sample size
  - 3-10 samples: 2.2
  - 11-20 samples: 2.7
  - 21-50 samples: 3.1
  - 50+ samples: 3.5
- **Advantage**: Statistically rigorous outlier detection

### 4. Dixon's Q Test
- **Method**: Tests both highest and lowest values for outlier status
- **Critical Q Values**: Sample-size dependent
  - 3-7 samples: 0.7
  - 8-10 samples: 0.54
  - 11-13 samples: 0.48
  - 14-30 samples: 0.43
  - 30+ samples: 0.35
- **Advantage**: Specifically designed for small samples

### 5. Isolation Forest-like Detection
- **Method**: Combines distance from median with local density analysis
- **Algorithm**: 
  - Calculate normalized distance from median
  - Assess local density (nearby points within MAD/2)
  - Isolation score = distance / (density + 0.1)
- **Threshold**: 2.0 for large datasets, 3.0 for small
- **Advantage**: Detects outliers in low-density regions

### 6. Enhanced MAD-based Detection
- **Method**: Robust Median Absolute Deviation approach
- **Threshold**: 3.0 (modified Z-score threshold)
- **Factor**: 1.4826 for normal distribution consistency
- **Advantage**: Most robust against outlier contamination

### 7. Tukey's Fences with Adaptive Thresholds
- **Base Method**: Q1 - 1.5√óIQR and Q3 + 1.5√óIQR
- **Enhancement**: Volatility-adjusted multipliers
- **Adjustment**: Base 1.5 + (CV/100) up to 2.5
- **Advantage**: Adapts to market volatility conditions

### 8. Source Reliability Weighted Detection
- **Method**: Filters based on computed source reliability scores
- **Threshold**: 70% of average reliability (minimum 30%)
- **Factors**: Reveal order, consistency, round number bias
- **Advantage**: Incorporates data quality metrics

### Consensus Mechanism
- **Voting System**: Each method votes on each price point
- **Consensus Threshold**: 
  - Small datasets (‚â§3): 4/8 methods agree
  - Volatile data (CV>20%): 5/8 methods agree  
  - Standard data: 6/8 methods agree
- **Fallback Strategy**: Progressive relaxation if too conservative

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Advanced Weighted Consensus Methods**

### 1. Distance-Based Weighted Consensus
- **Algorithm**: Weight inversely proportional to distance from median
- **Formula**: `weight = (max_distance - distance) + 1`
- **Advantage**: Robust against extreme values

### 2. Time-Weighted Average
- **Algorithm**: Newer data points receive higher weights
- **Formula**: `weight = index + 1` (recency bias)
- **Use Case**: When temporal freshness matters
- **Advantage**: Automatically prioritizes recent information

### 3. Volatility-Adjusted Weighted Consensus
- **Algorithm**: Weight inversely proportional to distance from mean
- **Formula**: `weight = (1.0 - distance_ratio) √ó 100 + 1`
- **Distance Ratio**: Capped at 90% to prevent zero weights
- **Advantage**: Emphasizes stable, consistent prices

### 4. Adaptive Robust Estimator
- **Low Volatility** (CV < 5%): Uses arithmetic mean
- **Medium Volatility** (CV 5-15%): Uses trimmed mean (10% trim)
- **High Volatility** (CV > 15%): Uses median
- **Advantage**: Automatically selects optimal method for market conditions

## üìä **Enhanced Statistical Analysis**

### Basic Statistics
- Count, Min, Max, Range, Mean, Median

### Variability Measures  
- Standard Deviation
- Robust Standard Deviation (1.4826 √ó MAD)
- Coefficient of Variation
- Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)

### Distribution Shape Analysis
- **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry
  - Negative: Left tail longer
  - Positive: Right tail longer  
  - Used for adaptive IQR multipliers
- **Kurtosis**: Measures tail heaviness
  - High: More outliers expected
  - Low: Fewer outliers expected
  - Used for outlier detection sensitivity

### Quartile Analysis
- Q1 (25th percentile)
- Q3 (75th percentile)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Used for robust outlier detection

## üéØ **Advanced Confidence Scoring**

### Multi-Dimensional Confidence Score
```rust
struct ConfidenceScore {
    percentage: u8,              // Overall confidence (0-100)
    bayesian_interval: (u128, u128), // Credible interval bounds
    bootstrap_variance: f64,      // Variance estimate
    temporal_consistency: f64,    // Time-series consistency
    cross_validation_score: f64,  // Cross-validation accuracy
}
```

### Confidence Calculation Factors

#### 1. Method-Based Confidence
- **Hodges-Lehmann**: 90% (most robust)
- **Median**: 85% (very robust)
- **Trimmed Mean**: 80% (moderately robust)
- **Weighted Consensus**: 75% (good balance)
- **Time-Weighted**: 80% (temporal bias)
- **Volatility-Adjusted**: 70% (volatility dependent)
- **Adaptive Robust**: 95% (best overall)

#### 2. Sample Size Bonus
- 1-2 samples: +0 points
- 3-5 samples: +5 points
- 6-10 samples: +10 points
- 11+ samples: +15 points

#### 3. Consensus Threshold Integration
- Formula: `(confidence √ó 0.7) + (consensus_threshold √ó 0.3)`
- Ensures both statistical robustness AND market agreement

## üîç **Enhanced Validation & Quality Control**

### Price Reasonableness Checks
1. **Range Validation**: $0.000001 to $1,000,000
2. **Pattern Detection**: 
   - All same digits (e.g., 111111)
   - Ascending/descending sequences (e.g., 123456)
3. **Digit Diversity**: Minimum 2 unique digits for prices > 2 digits
4. **Round Number Bias**: Flags excessive trailing zeros

### Source Reliability Scoring
- **Reveal Order Penalty**: Later reveals get lower scores
- **Consistency Bonus**: Prices close to existing median get higher scores
- **Pattern Penalty**: Round numbers get reduced reliability
- **Range**: 0.1 to 1.0 (minimum 10% reliability preserved)

### Consensus Validation
- **Large Datasets** (‚â•10 points): 70% consensus required
- **Small Datasets** (<10 points): 60% consensus required
- **Tolerance**: 5% of consensus price for agreement
